### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I have coded in a Computer science honors class 
The reasons I have selected this class is because it is like no other in the entire school and I would like to widen my horizons. Outside of this class I am very involved in tennis and spend a lot of time working to get better out of school. 
Some goals I have for this class and/or projects I'd like to complete: I would feel accomplished in this class if I had a better understanding of how to code things on my own.
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on thinking of something to code 
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science 
-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 
-ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding with gravity and motion 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 
ðŸ“« How to reach me: email
 ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
 âš¡ Fun fact: my birthday is in january
